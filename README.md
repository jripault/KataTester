Kata Tester
===========

Project which expose a webservice to send code to. It will try to pass test on it (after compilation). It returns simple message :
- All tests pass!
- There are some errors
- Don't try to hack!

Security is in place to avoid some hacking (almost nothing is possible, file access, system access, ...)
